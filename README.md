# POKEMON LIST: get all!

This is an easy Pokemon Web, where I show you my favorites Pokemon list.\
Every card have info about them: name, powers and attacks. Get all!

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Structure

I build an easy structure to understand the parts of the construction of the web.
The source file:\
-Index.js: connect App with public file\
-Components:\
·App: where it is the foundations\
·PokeList: paint the data list\
·Pokemon: paint a pokemon card\
-Data: json file where i pick info\
-Stylesheets: css (in this case)\
-Images\
